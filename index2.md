### Less important part

Here we can take the chance to use more advanced markdown tags like blockquotes:

> This is a blockquote!

Or maybe some code from the lab to show how smart we are?

    this is a piece
    of
    code

Of course, lists can not be forgotten:

* First
    * Yep, this is first
* Second
* Third
    * Ha-ha! Second has no sublist!
